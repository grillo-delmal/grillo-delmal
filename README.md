### About me

I am an experienced programmer, I'm the kind of person that likes to take things apart to see how they work 🪓.

I also like to contribute to projects, experienced in:
* reporting bugs
* patching buggy code with more buggy code
* implementing feautres
* software packaging (rpm and flatpak mostly) 👍. 

If you get a contribution from me, you can freely assume that I find your project fun enough to spend my free time on it 😄. 

My main interests go from games to anime and VR. I also love all sorts of software/hardware tech like:
* peripherals
* networking
* distributed systems
* embeded systems
* computer vision
* ... I could continue this list forever 👀

I speak Spanish and English fluently.
