### About me 👀

I am an experienced programmer who is not afraid to destroy things to see how they work 🪓😈.

I also like to contribute to projects, like reporting bugs, patching buggy code, send feautres or software packaging (rpm mostly) 👍. 

If you get a contribution from me, you can freely assume that I find your project fun enough to spend my free time on it 😄. My main intrests go from games to anime and VR. I also love all sorts of software/hardware tech like peripherals, networking, distributed systems, embeded systems, computer vision ... I could continue this list forever 😆

I also speak Spanish and English fluently.
